# GlobalFlightSimulator


This project, built in the Unity game engine, is a flight simulator which allows the user to fly a Boeing 787 Dreamliner across the globe. The airplane's destinations are set by clicking on the point on the globe you wish to fly to.

A predetermined flight plan can be set by adding (longitude, latitude) tuples to the locationsList list in PlaneMovementScript.cs (GlobalFlightSimulator/Assets/Scripts/PlaneMovementScript.cs).
